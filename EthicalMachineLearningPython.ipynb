    "#### Paige Bailey - 22 April 2018 (Editted For Python by Eric Schles)\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning systems often inherit biases against protected classes and historically disparaged groups via their training data [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08120.pdf). Though some biases in features are straightforward to detect (ex: age, gender, race), others are not explicit and rely on subtle correlations in machine learning algorithms to detect. The incorporation of unintended bias into predictive models is called _proxy discrimination_.\n",

    "![](ethical_bias.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will be implementing an example machine learning problem using decision trees, and determining whether its classification for loan recipients is biased against certain groups. We will explore several ways of detecting unintentional bias and removing it from our predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note**: the techniques used in this exercise only support _linear models_, _decision trees_, _rule lists_, and _random forests_ - not deep learning models or neural networks. However, the supported models represent a significant fraction of models used in practice in predictive systems that operate on personal information, ranging from advertising [2](http://www.bing.com), psychopathy [3](http://www.bing.com), criminal justice [4](http://www.bing.com), [5](http://www.bing.com), and actuarial sciences [6](http://www.bing.com), [7](http://www.bing.com).\n",

    "### Define the purpose and goal of your machine learning product.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you design the goal and the purpose of your machine learning product, you must first ask: **Who is your audience**?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is your product or analysis meant to include all people?\n",
    "* And, if not: is it targeted to an exclusive audience?\n",
    "* Is there a person on your team tasked specifically with identifying and resolving bias and discrimination issues?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our audience for this product will be managers at a bank who are tasked with making decisions on who should be given loans - decidedly **not** a public audience. As data the data scientist assigned to this project, we can assume that we are responsible for resolving all bias and discrimination issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have defined the concept of your machine learning problem, you need to **identify possible outcomes and define criteria that contribute to them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How transparent will you be about the relationships between the inputs and the anticipated outcomes?\n",
    "* Are there sensitive characteristics you need to monitor in your data in order to observe their effect on your outputs?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be extremely transparent with the managers, and likely less so with the bank's customers. Much of the data we will be dealing with is sensitive and personal - ages, addresses, credit histories, names, income.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Could your expectations rely on unacknowledged bias of you and your team?\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolutely - that is something that we are hoping to combat by examing any potential proxy bias. A way to check whether this analysis makes sense will be to ask a **diverse audience** if the expectations align with what is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the concept and scope have been defined, it is time to focus on the acquisition, evaluation, and cleaning of data. We have received a single .csv file filled with information on customers from the bank's manager. Some questions to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Did the data come from a system prone to human error?\n",
    "* Is the data current?\n",
    "* What technology facilitated the collection of the data?\n",
    "* Was participation of the data subjects voluntary?\n",
    "* Does the context of the collection match the context of your use?\n",
    "* Was your data collected by people or a system that was operating with quotas or a particular incentive structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "To the best of our knowledge, the data does not come from a system prone to human error, is current, and has been accepted as valid by our customer, the bank's manager. We do not know what technology facilitated the data collection, and we can assume that the data was submitted voluntary by potential loan awardees (the context of our use). \n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that your data has been collected, it would be a great idea to evaluate and describe it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Who is represented in the data?\n",
    "* Who is under-represented or absent from your data?\n",
    "* Can you find additional data, or use statistical methods, to make your data more inclusive?\n",
    "* Was the data collected in an environment where data subjects had meaningful choices?\n",
    "* How does the data reflect the perspective of the institution that collected it?\n",
    "* Were fields within the data inferred or appended beyond what was clear to the data subject?\n",
    "* Would this use of the data surprise the data subjects?\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step would be cleaning the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are there any fields that should be eliminated from your data?\n",
    "* Can you use anonymization or pseudonymization techniques to avoid needless evaluation or processing of individual data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Several known fields of bias (`gender`, `age`, and `race`) will need to be removed from the data set. Thankfully, the .csv file has already been anonymized; names, specific birth dates, and exact addresses have been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Import data \n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a synthetic data set, based heavily on the 1000-sample, open-source [German credit agency data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) hosted by UC Irvine. Four features were added: **zip code**, **race**, **gender**, and **status**. Racial and gender demographics by zip code are taken from 2010 United States Census data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the factors in our .csv are a mix of numeric and categorical features."
